    Project: Graphing Calculator
    Professor: SASSAN BARKESHLI
    Discription:
                 This graphing calculator can graph using the SFML.
                    The graph can do shift, zoom, and input functions.
                 Ths project use stack, queue, rpn, and shunting yard to store and convert functions, that can be ready
                    to use to graph.
                 The project is able to store writen functions, saved this as string.

                 This function takes an expression as a string, the high and low values for the function variable
                    and the increments and produces a queue of points that represent the graph.

                 The project is able to evaluate a postfix stack of tokens, and convert coordinate to screen coorinate.
