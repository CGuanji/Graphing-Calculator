Run the program first so that your project will make a build folder
(the program won't run in this case, but it will make a build folder).

Then, go to your project folder file. Copy and paste your font
files (arial.ttf and Roboto-Thin.ttf) into the build folder.

Re-run your program and it should work. Hopefully. :D
