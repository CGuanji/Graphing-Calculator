/*
    Implement:
        All implement well.
        The project is able to convert infix Queue<token>
            to a postfix Queue<Token>.
            Enable to evaluate postfix Queue
            Eable to evaluate postfix with variable x


    Bug:
        N/A

   Reflection:
        I still need to work on Tokenizer, and SFML graphing...
        And that probably would takes me some time
